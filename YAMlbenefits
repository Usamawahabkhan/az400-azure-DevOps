Classic UI
💗 No DSL (domain specific language) to learn, which enables super fast on-boarding, especially for those that come from a SysAdmin background rather than a Developer background
💗 Very easy to make quick changes, which encourages experimentation
😐 Contrary to popular belief, it does have versioning, and you can revert to a previous one easily
👎 It’s being deprecated. This will become lower and lower in Microsoft’s priority list when it comes to new features
YAML
💗 It is code, and managed as a source file, so it will go through a standard code review / pull request process
💗 Because it is in the repo, when you need to revert the source to an early commit, the pipeline will be reverted together as well
💗 Like all text files, it is easy to manipulate and change multiple values in one go. If needed it can even be generated from a script
💗 Comparing changes is much easier compared to the Classic UI versioning, which means it’s easier to identify root cause if build breaks
💗 Encourages collaboration — it’s much easier to code snippets through Slack or whatever than cropped screenshots
💗 Supports Container Jobs, which is quite important to some teams
😐 Azure DevOps does have assistant to help building a YAML file, so it’s not as daunting as it first looks for inexperienced users
👎 Not as mature as the Classic UI — some features are still on the roadmap
